# Single Header Metal-cpp

* The [`gh-actions` branch](https://github.com/briaguya-ai/single-header-metal-cpp/tree/gh-actions) generates the single file headers and pushes to new branches
  * This is based on the "Metal-cpp single header alternative" instructions here https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/
* All other branches will only ever have one autogenerated (non-empty) commit
